# Info-Center
This is an arduino project that I created, which allows for the control and manipulation of a clock, temperature and humidity sensor, photo-resistor, and LCD screen.
The kit that I used to complete this is the ELEGOO Mega Starter Kit, along with Arduino Studio IDE to code and upload my code to the microcontroller. 
To see the overall wiring diagram, look at my website on https://makimsahil.wixsite.com/sahilmakim/portfolio-collections/my-portfolio/project-title-2.
